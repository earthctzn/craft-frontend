# CRAFT-frontend

Welcome and thank you for using CRAFT!

## Getting Started

To run this webapp locally, you will need to fork [the backend repo](https://github.com/earthctzn/craft-backend) and [the frontend repo](https://github.com/earthctzn/craft-frontend). 
Once you have it downloaded and opened in a text editor like VSCode or Atom, you will need to install all the necessary gems to run CRAFT.

NOTE: This app uses PostgreSQL for the database so you will need to have that running before you run the backend. Once you have the DB and backend running you can start the frontend.

To start the frontend run:

```$ yarn start```

## This frontend was built with
